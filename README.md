So far, the TrackMyStuff! Application: 
* allows users to log in
* allows users to create accounts
* allows users to add inventory
* allows users to modify inventory
* Has a landing page prompting the user to get started
* Has an About page which is accessible to unlogged in and logged in users


In the future the TrackMyStuff! Application will: 
* allow a user to delete inventory
* feature more visually satisfying designs
* have a more detailed About page

Work Breakdown by Team Member
* Lisa Cheng

* Lizyl Failano

* Andrea Jans

* Sienne Rodwell
Sienne created the landing page and about pages. Sienne also modified the routing of the pages such that the About page is accessible for users who are both logged in and not logged in. Users who are creating an account for the first time will be taken to the About page. Users who have previous accounts will be taken to their View Inventory page.
